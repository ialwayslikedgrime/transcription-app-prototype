#  üéôÔ∏è Whisper Transcription Demo

A clean, modern web app that brings OpenAI Whisper (via Hugging Face Transformers) to a user-friendly interface.

### Why I built this

I wanted to streamline my study workflow: instead of running Python scripts for every lecture or research video, I now use this user-friendly tool daily. The app wraps local Whisper execution in a clean web interface with proper file handling and progress tracking.
Current architecture: Next.js frontend that spawns Python subprocesses locally for AI inference.


	‚Ä¢	Frontend: Next.js app with real-time progress, robust error handling, and a responsive UI.

	‚Ä¢	"""Backend""": Python executes Whisper through transformers (local inference), handling YouTube URLs, file uploads, and live mic recording.


I‚Äôm currently scaling from local execution to cloud deployment and using this project to learn full-stack development, model serving, auth, Stripe payments, and production ML pipelines‚Äîbridging the gap between ML models and real user applications.

## Current Learning & Development Roadmap

I am currently having fun in learning modern web development through this project. I am actively expanding this prototype into a production-ready SaaS application, using it as my hands-on learning vehicle for modern web development. 

I am currently working on and learning:

	‚Ä¢	Cloud deployment & model serving
	‚Ä¢	User authentication & roles
	‚Ä¢	Database integration (jobs, transcripts, usage)
	‚Ä¢	Stripe for subscriptions/payments
	‚Ä¢	LLM-powered features (summarization, highlights, Q&A)
	‚Ä¢	Observability (logging, metrics, tracing)
	‚Ä¢	Production hardening (rate limits, queues, retries)

‚∏ª

 My goal is to understand every layer of the stack, from ML model optimization to user experience design.
